# A Stupid Simple Lavalink Client

This is mostly just the result of me messing around with lavalink. 
Its a super simple library for interacting with lavalink, with an
equally simple example bot.

Note: I'm not really going to be working much on this so expect
no support or future updates. Feel free to do whatever you want
with this code.
